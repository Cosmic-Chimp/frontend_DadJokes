# Dad Joke API Project

## Overview

This project is a fullstack web application built with ASP.NET and a frontend built with React. The goal is to provide a lighthearted experience and for me to learn and practise ASP.NET and recap some React.

## Features

-   Fetches dad jokes from an external API(the one I've built on ASP.NET).
-   Displays jokes on a web page with a React-based frontend.
-   Built with ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend.
-   Allows users to fetch a new dad joke with a button click.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: ASP.NET Core (C#)
-   **Frontend**: React.js
-   **API**: Dad Joke API (or other API of choice)
-   **Database**: None (fetches jokes dynamically from the API)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   .NET SDK (for ASP.NET Core)
-   Node.js and npm (for React)
-   Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Cosmic-Chimp/frontend_DadJokes.git
    cd dadjoke-api
